# Introduction #

Google BigQuery Service allows you to run SQL-like queries against very large datasets, with potentially billions of rows. This can be your own data, or data that someone else has shared for you. BigQuery works best for interactive analysis of very large datasets, typically using a small number of very large, append-only tables. For more traditional relational database scenarios, you might consider using Google Cloud SQL instead. You can use BigQuery through a web UI called the BigQuery browser tool, the bq command-line tool, or by making calls to the REST API using various client libraries in multiple languages, such as Java, Python, etc. Learn more.

Starschema's BigQuery JDBC driver provide seamless integration between Google BigQuery and any other JDBC based reporting applications.
